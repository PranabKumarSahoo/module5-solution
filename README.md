# Description:-
  This is the 5th that is final assignment, 
  A simple Javascript programming problem to practice.
  In this assignment,
  1. I built a fully resopnsive & functional restaurant web application. 
  2. The front page of our web app contains 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map. 
  3. If you click on the Specials tile, you will be taken to a single category page where all the menu items that belong to the Specials menu category will be shown. 
  4. Your task in this assignment is to alter this behavior such that when the user clicks on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category, be it "Lunch", "Dinner", "Sushi", etc. 
  5. That way, any random category can become the Specials! 
  **What fun! (not! :-) )**
